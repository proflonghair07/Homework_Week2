## This project contains 3 html pages. The pages are index, contact, and portfolio. It uses bootstrap css and a stylesheet I created locally, in that order. My style sheet is second so that I am able to overwrite styles from bootstrap to get the results needed. All three pages contain identical nav bars and sticky footers. I activated the drop down menu for the header by adding bootstrap's javascript in a script tag. I placed this at the bottom of the page just before the closing body tag. I did this so that browser could load all of the graphical elements before loading the javascript. All three pages utilize Bootsraps components and grid system. The pages look good in all sizes of scalability. This was achieved by heavily using bootsraps classes. Especially the container row and col classes. These characteristics are shared by all 3 pages, but they are different from each other in other ways.

## The index page is an about me page. Aside from the header and footer all of this pages elements are contained in a singe main tag with a container class called from bootstrap. The container has the pages title in an h1 tag, a horizontal rule, an image nested in an img tag, and a short paragraph about me wrapped in a p tag. The container is responsive to different screen sizes because the tags within it contain bootstrap's row and col classes.

## The portfolio page is a short list of "accomplishments" that contains pictures and links. Like the index page, the portfolio page has an h1 tag with the pages title a horizontal rule beneath it. Also all of this pages elements are nested in a main tag with a container class from bootstrap. The container contains 4 sections with col classes from bootstrap. Each section has an anchor tag with an image, an h2 with a title, and a p with some text. Because all of these elements are contained within an a tag the whole container functions as a link when clicked.
